    <p>"The world is full of fascinating places.
      Planning the perfect vacation involves packing up, leaving home, and experiencing something new.</p>
    <h2 class="destination">1. Florence, Italy</h2>
    <p>A city-size shrine to the Renaissance, Florence offers frescoes, sculptures, churches, palaces, and other
      monuments from the richest cultural flowering the world has known. Names from its dazzling historical

    <h2 class="destination">2. Beijing, China</h2>
    <p>A city in the midst of reinventing itself and continuing to build on the success of the 2008 Summer
      Olympics, Beijing is a place of frenzied construction. New housing, new roads, and new sports venues
      seem to spring up overnight. At the same time, the capital of the Peoples Republic of China remains
      an epicenter of tradition, with the treasures of nearly 2,000 years as the imperial capital still on
      viewin the famed Forbidden City and in the luxuriant pavilions and gardens of the Summer Palace.

      <h2 class="destination uppercase">3. Seoul, South Korea</h2>
      <p>The Korean capital is a city of contrasts. Fourteenth-century city gates squat in the shadow of
        21st-century skyscrapers, while the broad Han River is back-dropped by granite mountains rising in
        the city centercomplete with alpine highways speeding around their contours and temples nestling among
        their crags. Fashionable, gadget-laden youths battle for sidewalk space with fortune-tellers and peddlers,
        while tiny neighborhoods of traditional cottages contrast with endless ranks of identical apartments.
